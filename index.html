    <h1>Rules of the Country Game</h1>
    <h2>Every country starts with 5000 of each categorie.</h2>
<h2>Military
Population
Materials
Money</h2>
    <h2>Each category can be exchanged for others,
    this creates the idea of trades and deals.</h2>
    <h1>Obtaining Materials, Military, Population and Money</h1>
    <p>Materials can be used to create cities and infrastructure 
        around your country, so having enough materials is important.
    To get Materials by yourself it will cost money because you have
    to pay your workers a salary. If you dont your people can revolt,
    to see more about this go to the world events paragraph.
    Military is always needed to keep your people safe and land protected,
    so you will want to keep your number high. Ways to do this are, Deals with other countries and Exchanging your money for it</p>
    <p>There is always the option to rely on stronger countries to protect you or try to be neutral.
    Population is needed to make money by taxes, Every day you will recieve from
    your people amount of people√∑5 Money. So basically if you have 25k people, every week you will gain 5k.
    Your Population grows based of the global birth rate which is normally 1k every day, but this can increase or
    decrease with world events, to learn more see the world events paragraph.
    Money is the last category and it the most important as you can buy land, materials and Military from
    other countries. Remember you gain money from your Population. Also land trading should be decided between
        the 2 countries about how much land and the cost.</p>
